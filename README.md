# VLite #

VLite is a packet acceleration, protection, stabilization, and forwarding engine and utility. It can transmit the
packets over UDP, HTTP, WebSocket connections, and optionally any connection. It will be able to achieve full cone(more
on that later) UDP P2P Connectivity if the server's network environment supports it. It can be configured to
automatically compensate for network issue by aggressively maintaining a stable connection and take as many resources as
necessary to stabilize and accelerate the network environment for the client while conserving the resource when the
client isn't actively using it.

## Status ##

VLite is currently in development. It already works as a minimal viable product right now.

The development objective is to integrate it into V2Ray/[V2Fly](https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core) and provide a
comprehensive gaming support for V2Ray. It will be relicensed into an open source license during integration.
